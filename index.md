Hi, thanks for checking out my small corner of the internet. As a product leader and generalist for over a decade, I've come to value working with good people on fun products. I have professional experience in product strategy, project management, and bluetooth. I dabble in community, ux, marketing and data. Projects where I'm particularly valuable usually have me operating at the intersection of multiple people either talking past each other or struggling to cohere around a singular animating vision.

I'd love to hear from you if you're working on something that could use some help.
