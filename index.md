> "Building the operational backbone for tech companies that need to ship products faster than they can hire."

**Tech companies don't need more coordination hires. They need better systems.**

Most companies reflexively add program managers when delivery slows, creating an expensive solution that often makes the problem worse.
The truth? Your existing engineering team can handle coordination when equipped with:

1. The right tools, properly configured
1. Simple communication protocols tailored to their working style
1. Automation that eliminates administrative overhead


You're already paying for solutions you're not using effectively. **The coordination gap isn't a headcount problem. It's a systems problem.**
With a custom operational backbone, your current team can ship faster than you thought possible.

I solve coordination problems for tech companies by drawing on over a decade of experience building and shipping complex products across the technology spectrum.
My career spans leadership roles at industry giants and nimble startups:

- At Amazon, I drove cross-team software development for the Echo Loop and founded Alexa mobile accessories
- At Meta, I led connectivity feature development for Ray-Ban Stories, stabilizing app, Bluetooth, and WiFi connections
- As co-founder of Dendron (YC W21), I scaled to a 10-person, remote team that shipped weekly at high quality

When you work with me, you get a dedicated program management veteran who has implemented effective coordination systems across hardware and software development cycles. No junior associates, no bait-and-switch tactics—just battle-tested expertise applied directly to your challenges.
I'll embed within your organization to design and implement an operational backbone tailored to your team's specific needs. My services operate on a weekly rate with the flexibility to cancel the moment you feel you're not getting exceptional value.

My process unfolds in three stages:

## 1. Build Coordination Infrastructure

I join your team and implement proven coordination frameworks tailored to your specific needs. This includes setting up the right mix of tools your engineers will actually use, establishing communication protocols that match your team's style, and automating administrative overhead that's currently consuming valuable engineering time. While your competitors struggle with bloated PM processes and underutilized tools, you'll operate with surgical precision—using systems sophisticated enough to be effective but simple enough to maintain.

## 2. Run Daily Operations

With infrastructure in place, I work alongside your team to embed these coordination practices. For many organizations, this becomes the first time projects consistently deliver on schedule, at high quality. This transformation happens through disciplined operational practices and leveraging executive support to remove blockers that typically stall development. Throughout this phase, I work directly with your engineers, identifying natural coordination leaders who will sustain these practices after my departure.

## 3. Separate

As coordination becomes second nature, I prepare your team for independence. I focus on transferring ownership of the operational backbone, documenting processes, and ensuring your engineers are confident in maintaining the system. Unlike traditional consultants who create dependency, my goal is to make myself unnecessary by embedding these capabilities permanently within your organization. When I leave, you'll have a self-sustaining coordination machine that runs without adding specialized headcount.RetryClaude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.

## Let's work together 

Hi, thanks for checking out my small corner of the internet. As a product leader and generalist for over a decade, I've come to value working with good people on fun products. I have professional experience in product strategy, project management, and bluetooth. I dabble in community, ux, marketing and data. Projects where I'm particularly valuable usually have me operating at the intersection of multiple people either talking past each other or struggling to execute around a singular animating vision.

I'd love to hear from you if you're working on something that could use some help.
