I am currently a growth startup consultant and generalist technology professional. My career has been focused on product development (consumer facing) with a strong technical background in connectivity technologies (Bluetooth being my bread and butter). I enjoy exploring complex problems across people, process and physics and am addicted to that Aha! moment that strikes when a novel approach presents itself. 

I'm based in the Pacific Northwest, somewhere between Seattle and Bangalore (these two cities are not as far apart as you'd think) and I've spent the last year on a sabbatical only doing some light consulting work for friends but full-time traveling with my wife and two-year-old. In 2022, we joined three other families we met online and became founding members of the [Traveling Village](https://travelingvillage.com/). 

In 2021, I joined a college friend to grow [Dendron](https://www.dendron.so/) from two founders to a ten-person remote team. That catapulted me into the world of startups and growth marketing. We worked through our initial bootstrapping problems, got seed funded but never quite figured out monetization. This is about when I began to be interested in what a career as an indie consultant would look like. I had a lot of fun leveraging my experience in VR to help flesh out a funding opportunity for a startup looking to upgrade Formula 1 racetracks and my consulting practice was off to the races. 

I spent the early portion of my career on the Microsoft Bluetooth Team where I worked across the stack on Windows Phone and Windows but was most at home designing and promoting the Windows [Bluetooth developer facing APIs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/events/build-2016/p416). I then joined Amazon where after a brief stint in managing a cloud service in the Amazon Appstore, I got to work a dream role on the Alexa team, part of the founding team of [Alexa Mobile Accessories](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/ama-kit/alexa-mobile-accessory-kit-overview.html). I shipped multiple devices (most notably Alexa-enabling the Bose QC35 and the Echo Loop) and that period of my career was formative in building up my models for product development and business strategy. After that, I did a short-stint at Meta Reality Labs where I got to work on the first-gen Rayban Stories, again bringing my experience with app-to-device connectivity to bear. The [Stories](https://tech.facebook.com/reality-labs/2021/9/ray-ban-and-facebook-introduce-ray-ban-stories-first-generation-smart-glasses/) have the distinction of being the product I've most used after having worked on it.
