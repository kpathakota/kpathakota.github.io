## About Me

I am a strategic technical consultant helping startups navigate the complex intersection of hardware and software. My career spans product development with deep expertise in connectivity technologies (Bluetooth remains my superpower). I thrive on untangling complex problems across people, process, and technology – constantly chasing that unmistakable "Aha!" moment when disparate elements suddenly align into an elegant solution.

Currently based in the Pacific Northwest, I've established my independent consulting practice offering three core services: Connected Product Strategy, Technology Leadership Consulting, and Startup Growth Architecture. This venture builds on my experience working with companies from early-seed startups to public small caps, helping them bridge technical vision with market reality.

My journey into independent consulting began in 2022 after co-founding [Dendron](https://www.dendron.so/), where I helped grow our note-taking-for-developers platform from two founders to a ten-person remote team. We raised a $2M seed round and learned countless lessons about scaling an open source product – including the hard-won insight that finding product-market fit is never as straightforward as it seems.

Before my startup adventures, I built my technical foundation at some of tech's most innovative companies. At Meta Reality Labs, I worked on the first-generation [Ray-Ban Stories](https://tech.facebook.com/reality-labs/2021/9/ray-ban-and-facebook-introduce-ray-ban-stories-first-generation-smart-glasses/) – still the product I've most frequently used after having worked on it. At Amazon, I was part of the founding team for [Alexa Mobile Accessories](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/ama-kit/alexa-mobile-accessory-kit-overview.html), where I shipped multiple devices including Alexa-enabling the Bose QC35 and the Echo Loop. This period profoundly shaped my approach to product development and business strategy.

My career began at Microsoft, where I worked on the Bluetooth Team, designing and promoting the Windows [Bluetooth developer-facing APIs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/events/build-2016/p416). This early work established my technical foundation and sparked my ongoing interest in the human side of technology adoption.

Outside of work, I'm passionate about community and connection. In 2022, my family and I joined forces with three other families we met online to form the [Traveling Village](https://travelingvillage.com/). This adventure in collaborative living and world exploration continues to influence how I think about teams, collaboration, and the future of work.
