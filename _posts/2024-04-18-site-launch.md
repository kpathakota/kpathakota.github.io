First post and I'd officially call this site "launched". It's really incredible how fast anyone can get a free site up and running today. First commit was two days ago and I probably had to put 4 hours of clock time into this quick first version. 

My preferred setup was [Github Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with the [Minimal Mistakes Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/). 

I'm sure the setup will complexify with future updates but I'm left feeling really optimistic about how continued investment can yield simple user experiences.
